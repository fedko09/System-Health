# System-Health
System Health Snapshot is a PowerShell-based diagnostic tool for Windows 10/11. It provides hardware specs, disk health, services, software inventory, security status, performance, network tests, event summaries, and generates full HTML reports with sortable, filterable data.

PS1 and EXE are the same app, just different execution. Use as see fit. 

> With PS1 file, drop the file in a location, open terminal/powershell, navigate to the directory, use **Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass** to remove script prompt, and then type in the .\SystemHealthSnapshot.ps1 and enter. Execution policy will reset with close/reopen of terminal window.
